//+ make previous times more accurate (pop out after skip)
//+ remove editors mode
//+ show cahnge password/new user only when needed

//+ film, missing providers ??
//+ show logged in feedback
//+ api, fixed stupid bug when parsing locales

//+ config, three-phase-checkbox, toggle when text clicked (not only on checkbox)
//+ stream, autofocus film, so that space works as play pause...
//+ search, default image instead of broken
//+ upgrade sync algorithm
//+ read tag list from default list, not from settings (as tags might be updated)
//+ utils, improve tag list
//+ allow backward seek on Netflix

//+ edit, allow sharing tagged scenes
//+ all, check service.syncRef is never used
//+ stream, on scene edit, share only visible if edited :)
//+ api, feels slow, check why. It isn't really with the new cache
//+ api, share syncRef on individual call
//+ stream, allow sharing only some of the scenes
//+ config, send feedback

//+ stream, try load webview a bit faster
//+ stream, preview a bit shorter (maybe)
//+ stream, close button on scene list (top right)
//+ stream, disable transitions between dialogs
//+ stream, missing tags on two columns
//+ stream, new scenes should be created as "edited"
//+ stream, that green is awful
//+ stream, change the "you do not have permissions"
//+ stream, times should be on time format :)
//+ stream, data is modified by default, allow cancel changes
//+ stream, when manually going to a time-to-be-skipped, the screen becomes black and it's hard to get back to normal
//+ stream, save scene.edited instead of calculating it each time (if scene is edited, but already shared as feedback, we might want to stop annoying the user, maybe)
