Will do
*******
+ config, do not force country
+ film, untagged scenes show tooltip if too many
+ film, explain what checking the box means (skiping or watching?)
+ stream, scene list on scene edit should be dark style
+ stream, allow login in from scene share
+ stream, allow sharing only some of the scenes
+ stream, change the "you do not have permissions"
+ stream, on currentScene preview, reload with the same data



Seem hard
*********
+ config, three-phase-checkbox, toggle when text clicked
+ stream, on preview, do not override current skip list (need to perform sync, as time offset might be different, use store list...)
