Will do
*******
+ api, store users email when the loggin
+ api, share syncref only when user.level>=2
+ api, download syncRef on another call, only if it was updated
+ api, make sure we save username, token, and level, might be good to save all inside settings
+ api, store offset data on non-master versions
+ stream, on scene edit, share only visible if edited :)
+ stream, save scene.edited instead of calculating it each time (if scene is edited, but already shared as feedback, we might want to stop annoying the user, maybe)
+ read tag list from deafault list, not from settings (as tags might be updated)
+ search, on back pressed, search the last search again
+ film, on back pressed, show last item
+ stream, allow login in from scene share
+ film, get providers for tv series
+ api, feels slow, check why
+ search, default image instead of broken
+ film, show pg code
+ utils, improve tag list
+ stream, editing time does weird things: it starts with hours = 1 (while should be 0) and every time we add/substract seconds/milliseconds/minutes the hours also increase/decrease by one every time (when using up/down)
+ stream, To start/end scene creation while watching, the "point" key to do so is not working anymore (might be coz watched element is not focus when pressed??)
+ film, fit all providers on list, or allow scrolling...
+ community, send log with suggestions





Seem hard
*********
+ film, plot text, on overflow, show elepsis
+ config, three-phase-checkbox, toggle when text clicked (not only on checkbox)
+ stream, on preview, do not override current skip list (need to perform sync, as time offset might be different, use store list...)
