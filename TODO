TODO
====

Blocking
********
+ api, store users email when they log in
+ read tag list from default list, not from settings (as tags might be updated)
+ utils, improve tag list
+ stream, editing time does weird things: it starts with hours = 1 (while should be 0) and every time we add/substract seconds/milliseconds/minutes the hours also increase/decrease by one every time (when using up/down)


Can wait
*********
+ api, store offset data on non-master versions
+ community, send log with suggestions
+ stream, To start/end scene creation while watching, the "point" key to do so is not working anymore (might be coz watched element is not focus when pressed??)
+ stream, autofocus film, so that space works as play pause...
+ search, on back pressed, search the last search again
+ film, on back pressed, show last item
+ film, show pg code
+ api, share syncref only when user.level>=2
+ search, default image instead of broken
+ api, get providers for tv series
+ api, download syncRef on another call, only if it was updated
+ api, make sure we save username, token, and level, might be good to save all inside settings
+ search, merge the two search screens


At some point
*************
+ film, fit all providers on list, or allow scrolling...
+ film, plot text, on overflow, show elepsis
+ config, three-phase-checkbox, toggle when text clicked (not only on checkbox)
+ stream, on preview, do not override current skip list (need to perform sync, as time offset might be different, use store list...)


Done
****
//+ edit, allow sharing tagged scenes
//+ all, check service.syncRef is never used
//+ stream, on scene edit, share only visible if edited :)
//+ api, feels slow, check why. It isn't really with the new cache
//+ api, share syncRef on individual call
//+ stream, allow sharing only some of the scenes
//+ config, send feedback
//+ film, when poster is too wide
//+ film, untagged scenes show tooltip if too many
//+ film, tv series, use default background
//+ config, do not force country
//+ stream, on currentScene preview, reload with the same data
//+ search, add thumbails
//+ film, explain what checking the box means (skiping or watching?)
//+ film, untagged scenes (make smaller)
//+ film, untagged scenes (say multiple)
//+ film, share button only when share is available (not when editors mode)
//+ film, too many items on list, make it more compact
//+ film, hide editors control on imdb/kids in mind screen, disable dot...
//+ stream, try load webview a bit faster
//+ stream, preview a bit shorter (maybe)
//+ stream, close button on scene list (top right)
//+ stream, disable transitions between dialogs
//+ stream, missing tags on two columns
//+ stream, new scenes should be created as "edited"
//+ stream, that green is awful
//+ stream, change the "you do not have permissions"
//+ stream, times should be on time format :)
//+ stream, data is modified by default, allow cancel changes
//+ stream, when manually going to a time-to-be-skipped, the screen becomes black and it's hard to get back to normal
//+ stream, save scene.edited instead of calculating it each time (if scene is edited, but already shared as feedback, we might want to stop annoying the user, maybe)
